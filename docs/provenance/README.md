# Provenance

This folder contains evidence artifacts only.

Allowed contents:
- baseline definitions (pinned versions for “Jazzy+rclcpp+Nav2”)
- citations tables (URLs + excerpts)
- oracle run logs/results
- divergence records (spec vs baseline mismatches)
- traceability matrices (spec clause → upstream reference → harness/test)

Non-evidence planning/migration material belongs in `docs/workbench/`.
