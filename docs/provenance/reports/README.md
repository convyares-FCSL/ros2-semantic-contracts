This directory contains **stable methodology and contract documents** only.

## Stable Documents

- `provenance_gate_contract.md` — Stage-2+ enforcement rules
- `backend_ros_next_scenarios.md` — Recommended scenario implementation list

## Transient Reports (Moved)

Dated audit reports, suitability analyses, and smoke set outputs are stored in:

These are execution artifacts, not documentation.
