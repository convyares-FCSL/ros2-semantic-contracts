This repository defines transport-agnostic, testable semantic contracts for ROS 2 mechanisms (e.g., lifecycle, actions, parameters) and provides reference executable semantics plus contract tests to detect divergence across client libraries and ecosystem stacks; where upstream documentation is silent, the de-facto baseline oracle is ROS 2 Jazzy with rclcpp and mature stacks such as Nav2, and this repo makes those semantics explicit, citable, and verifiable.
